# GSoC-PW-test
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mkyl/GSoC-PW-test.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mkyl/GSoC-PW-test)

Coding test for Google Summer of Code project with the Physical Web team

**Note:** I have chosen to implement the code using Java because I am applying for the Museum Backend project, which will require coding some parts in Android.

## Instructions
After cloning, run `gradle build` to compile the code. You can also run `gradle check` to run the built in tests and generate a report.
